Summary of the conversation so far:
- The user inquired about how to integrate a new model interface for Google Gemini's image API into the existing codebase, specifically asking for a plan rather than implementation details.

- The assistant acknowledged the user's request and indicated the need to research how the current project handles model requests to design an appropriate integration plan.

- The assistant performed a codebase search for the term "处理模型请求 model request API 接口" to identify existing implementations related to model requests. The search returned several relevant code snippets:
    - In `src/chat/chat.ts`, the `ChatCoreContext` class is defined, which includes methods for updating the chat model and creating model clients. Notably, the `createModelClient` method (lines 62-109) splits the model name to identify the provider and model, retrieves configurations, and initializes the model client.
    - The `askWithTool` method (lines 169-230) shows how the current model is updated and how prompts are processed before being sent.
    - The `src/assets/conf/models.toml` file contains configurations for various models, including Google Gemini, indicating that the system supports multiple providers and models.
    - The `src/components/ask/ModelDropDown.tsx` file manages the dropdown for selecting models, fetching available models from the configuration storage.

- The assistant then conducted another codebase search for "模型图片接口 image API multimodal vision" to gather more information about image processing capabilities. This search yielded additional insights:
    - The `src/pages/options/Options.tsx` file includes a component that manages user interface elements but does not directly relate to model integration.
    - The `src/assets/conf/models.toml` file was referenced again, confirming the presence of configurations for image models, including Google Gemini's image capabilities.
    - The `src/components/ask-panel.tsx` file contains the `AskPanel` component, which integrates various dropdowns for model selection and user input handling.

- The assistant's findings indicate that the project has a structured approach to managing different models and their configurations, which will facilitate the integration of the new Google Gemini image API. The assistant is expected to continue exploring the codebase to finalize the integration plan.
- The assistant requested more information, specifically details about multimodal interfaces and image processing, to better understand the integration of the new model.

- The assistant performed a codebase search using the query "多模态支持 图片处理 vision image content HumanMessage AIMessage multimodal" to gather relevant information about multimodal support and image processing capabilities. The search returned several code snippets:
    - In `src/components/ask-panel.tsx`, the `AskPanel` component is defined, which manages user input and displays quotes. It includes a method for truncating content and handling click events outside the panel (lines 33-150).
    - The `src/types.ts` file defines various message types, including `HumanInvisibleMessage`, `HumanAskMessage`, and `AIInvisibleMessage`, which are used to manage message visibility and content (lines 5-84).
    - The `src/chat/chat.ts` file imports `ChatOpenAI` and defines the `ChatCoreContext` class, which manages chat history and model interactions (lines 1-279). It includes methods for processing messages and handling user input.

- The assistant then indicated the need to check the `langchain` library's `ChatOpenAI` and Gemini-related content to understand how the project utilizes these models.

- The assistant conducted a grep search for "ChatOpenAI|gemini|multimodal|vision|image_url" to find relevant references in the codebase. The search yielded the following notable results:
    - In `src/assets/conf/models.toml`, a commented line indicates a model configuration for "gemini-pro" with a maximum token limit (line 57).
    - In `src/components/ask-panel.tsx`, there is a conditional check for `cur.type == 'image_url'`, which processes image URLs (lines 224-225).
    - The `src/chat/chat.ts` file shows multiple instances of `ChatOpenAI` being instantiated, indicating its central role in the chat functionality (lines 0, 17, 33, 40, 63, 105).

- The assistant's findings from the searches suggest that the project has a well-defined structure for handling multimodal interactions and image processing, which will aid in the integration of the new model. The assistant is expected to continue exploring the codebase to finalize the integration plan.
- The assistant provided a detailed implementation plan for integrating the Google Gemini image API into the existing Askman project. The plan includes an analysis of the current codebase, outlining the model management system, message sending process, and interface components.

- The assistant outlined the current state of the codebase, noting that the project uses the `@langchain/openai` library's `ChatOpenAI` class for model requests, with configurations stored in `models.toml`. It highlighted the need to extend existing logic for handling `image_url` types and described the role of the `ChatCoreContext` class in managing message history and sending requests.

- The assistant proposed a step-by-step implementation plan, which includes:
    1. Adding Google Gemini model configuration to `models.toml`, including a new SDK type and model details.
    2. Creating a `GeminiChatModel` adapter class to handle message formatting and streaming responses.
    3. Modifying the `ChatCoreContext` class to support different model SDKs, including the new Gemini model.
    4. Implementing image handling functionality in the `askWithTool` method to support image messages.
    5. Enhancing the UI to include an image upload button and related logic for handling image uploads.
    6. Updating the message display component to render images appropriately.
